The river is \"a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the depths of the land.\" In the course of his travel in central Africa, Marlow becomes obsessed with Mr. Kurtz. The story is a complex exploration of the attitudes people hold on what constitutes a barbarian versus a civilized society and the attitudes on colonialism and racism that were part and parcel of European imperialism. Originally published as a three-part serial story, in Blackwood's Magazine, the novella Heart of Darkness has been variously published and translated into many languages. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Heart of Darkness one of the hundred best novels in English of the twentieth century.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783736800830"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3736800835"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":154,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3,"ratingsCount":2,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.116.111.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Heart+of+Darkness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":2.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":2.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-HlVoAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":2990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Heart_of_Darkness-sample-epub.acsm?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Heart_of_Darkness-sample-pdf.acsm?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HlVoAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The story is a complex exploration of the attitudes people hold on what constitutes a barbarian versus a civilized society and the attitudes on colonialism and racism that were part and parcel of European imperialism."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["classics","fiction"],"title":"Heart of Darkness","hashCode":829704732,"goodReadsId":null},{"author":"Heinlein, Robert","date":"2006-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"BOh9PwAACAAJ","etag":"rEfHRJ/5t1c","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BOh9PwAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Orphans of the Sky","authors":["Robert A.

CRENSON"],"publisher":"Harvard University Press","publishedDate":"2009-06-30","description":"In 1996, America abolished its long-standing welfare system in favor of a new and largely untried public assistance program. Welfare as we knew it arose in turn from a previous generation's rejection of an even earlier system of aid. That generation introduced welfare in order to eliminate orphanages. This book examines the connection between the decline of the orphanage and the rise of welfare. Matthew Crenson argues that the prehistory of the welfare system was played out not on the stage of national politics or class conflict but in the micropolitics of institutional management. New arrangements for child welfare policy emerged gradually as superintendents, visiting agents, and charity officials responded to the difficulties that they encountered in running orphanages or creating systems that served as alternatives to institutional care. Crenson also follows the decades-long debate about the relative merits of family care or institutional care for dependent children. Leaving poor children at home with their mothers emerged as the most generally acceptable alternative to the orphanage, along with an ambitious new conception of social reform. Instead of sheltering vulnerable children in institutions designed to transform them into virtuous citizens, the reformers of the Progressive era tried to integrate poor children into the larger society, while protecting them from its perils.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0674029992"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780674029996"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":400,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.1.1.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC&pg=PA90&dq=Orphanage&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":42,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":31.08,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC&rdid=book-MRfs7JJAE9gC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":42000000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":31080000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Building_the_Invisible_Orphanage-sample-epub.acsm?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Building_the_Invisible_Orphanage-sample-pdf.acsm?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MRfs7JJAE9gC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Boston stood for the outward extension of the <b>orphanage</b> into the society that <br>\nsurrounded it; New York, for the elaboration of the institution&#39;s internal structure <br>\nand complexity.

Dick's final trilogy (followed by The Divine Invasion andThe Transmigration of Timothy Archer), VALIS encapsulates many of the themes that Dick was obsessed with over the course of his career. A disorienting and bleakly funny novel,VALIS (which stands for Vast Active Living Intelligence System) is about a schizophrenic man named Horselover Fat (who just might also be known as Philip Dick); the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity; and reality as revealed through a pink laser.VALIS is a theological detective story, in which God is both a missing person and the perpetrator of the ultimate crime. Taking place in the same universe as Dick's soon-to-be-published Exegesis,VALIS is a dense novel, but one that is absolutely essential to understanding the author's off-kilter worldview. Much like Dick himself, the reader is left wondering what is real, what is fiction, and what the price is for divine inspiration.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780547572413"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0547572417"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":271,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":28,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=VALIS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&dq=VALIS&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Valis.html?hl=&id=1V9_sv_BudkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Horselover Fat begins receiving what he considers to be divine revelations that imply extraterrestrial forces are interfering in the affairs of the Earth."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["sciFi","fiction"],"title":"VALIS","hashCode":81434603,"goodReadsId":"43713932"},{"author":"Gaiman, Neil","date":"2007-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"cLhVjQGs83QC","etag":"oqVf8l/z+u0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cLhVjQGs83QC","volumeInfo":{"title":"American Gods","authors":["Neil Gaiman"],"publisher":"Harper Collins","publishedDate":"2002-04-30","description":"Shadow is a man with a past.

Every grass-roots enthusiast, keen racing man and elite professional has one thing in common: he loves his bike and riding it. The author pinpoints the source of his love, tracing its development in the individual, how it draws people into a community and then a tradition – creating a whole worldwide culture to celebrate that deep affection for what is a technological marvel and transcendent experience. Great champions, too, are inseparable from their bikes. They merge into them, becoming a composite image, figures of myth. As well as exerting an emotional hold, cycling, in its famous races, also mounts a living proof of exemplary virtues: courage, perseverance and self-sacrifice – gives us, in fact, a glimpse of the higher reaches of the human spirit. There is a sense of this mythical realm in every pedal turn, for once astride a handbuilt lightweight we are put in touch with the greatest riders of all time. Bikie is the story of one man’s passionate involvement, but in its forthright sincerity it goes to the roots of what we all share.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781780575155"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1780575157"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":192,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m3SEEJhRqoQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m3SEEJhRqoQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m3SEEJhRqoQC&pg=PT54&dq=Bikie&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m3SEEJhRqoQC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m3SEEJhRqoQC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":11.27,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.02,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m3SEEJhRqoQC&rdid=book-m3SEEJhRqoQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":11270000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9020000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Bikie-sample-epub.acsm?id=m3SEEJhRqoQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=m3SEEJhRqoQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"<b>Bikie</b>.

Although he never ran for elected office, the former president of the University of North Carolina was prominent in public affairs for decades and ranked as one of the most important American university presidents of the post-World War II era. In this comprehensive biography, William Link traces Friday's long and remarkable career. Friday's thirty years as president of the university, from 1956 to 1986, spanned the greatest period of growth for higher education in American history, and he played a crucial role in shaping the sixteen-campus university during that time of tumultuous social change. In the 1960s and 1970s, he confronted a series of administrative challenges, including the expansion of the university system, the evolving role of the federal government in the affairs of a public university, an intercollegiate athletics scandal, the anticommunism crusade and the Speaker Ban, and racial integration. Link also explores Friday's influential work outside the university in American higher education, on the Carnegie Commission on the Future of American Education and the White House Task Force on Education, and in the development of the National Humanities Center and the growth of Research Triangle Park. After retiring from the university, Friday headed the William R. Kenan, Jr., Fund and the Kenan Charitable Trust. He died October 12, 2012.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780807863008"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0807863009"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":512,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.3.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fxwPjyraDEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fxwPjyraDEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fxwPjyraDEoC&pg=PA1957&dq=Friday&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fxwPjyraDEoC&dq=Friday&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/William_Friday.html?hl=&id=fxwPjyraDEoC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/William_Friday-sample-epub.acsm?id=fxwPjyraDEoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fxwPjyraDEoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Chapter 4 The Roaring Lions of Reaction On May 8, 1957, Bill <b>Friday</b> was <br>\ninaugurated as UNC president in the William Neal Reynolds Coliseum at State <br>\nCollege.

In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Lanny Budd’s financial acumen and his marriage into great wealth enable him to continue the lifestyle he has always enjoyed. But the devastation the collapse has wrought on ordinary citizens has only strengthened Lanny’s socialist ideals—much to the chagrin of his heiress wife, Irma, a confirmed capitalist. In Germany to visit relatives, Lanny encounters a disturbing atmosphere of hatred and jingoism. His concern over the growing popularity of the Nazi Party escalates when he meets Adolf Hitler, the group’s fanatical leader, and the members of his inner circle. But Lanny’s gravest fear is the threat a national socialist government poses to the German Jewish family of Hansi, the musician husband of Lanny’s sister, Bess—a threat that will impel the international art dealer to risk his wealth, his future, even his life in a courageous attempt to rescue his loved ones from a terrible fate. Winner of the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Dragon’s Teeth brilliantly captures the nightmarish march toward the Second World War. An astonishing mix of history, adventure, and romance, the Lanny Budd Novels are a testament to the breathtaking scope of Upton Sinclair’s vision and his singular talents as a storyteller.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781504026475"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1504026470"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":662,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.25.23.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dragon%27s+Teeth&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":19.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.33,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gOMlCwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":19990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11330000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true},{"finskyOfferType":3,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":2690000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"rentalDuration":{"unit":"DAY","count":3}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Dragon_s_Teeth-sample-epub.acsm?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Dragon_s_Teeth-sample-pdf.acsm?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"An astonishing mix of history, adventure, and romance, the Lanny Budd Novels are a testament to the breathtaking scope of Upton Sinclair’s vision and his singular talents as a storyteller."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["fiction"],"title":"Dragon's Teeth","hashCode":2063235239,"goodReadsId":"28162884"},{"author":"Campbell, Jack","date":"2007-07-02T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"fE-gcu9v2JwC","etag":"oOIhYNuXkgU","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fE-gcu9v2JwC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Lost Fleet: Dauntless","publisher":"Penguin","publishedDate":"2006","description":"Returning from survival hibernation and assuming the command of the Alliance fleet, legendary hero Captain John \"Black Jack\" Geary must retrieve the stolen Syndic hypernet key to save the Alliance from destruction at the hands of the Syndics.

There, a multitude of possible routes home give the Alliance fleet a better chance of avoiding their pursuers—and an attack on the Sancere shipbuilding facilities could decimate the Syndic war effort.

In an ancient sense, done right, it is a healing art. It’s intellectual self-defense. It’s a form of therapy. But it’s also much more. Philosophy is map-making for the soul, cartography for the human journey. It’s an important navigational tool for life that too many modern people try to do without. Philosophy For Dummies is for anyone who has ever entertained a question about life and this world. In a conversational tone, the book's author – a modern-day scholar and lecturer – brings the greatest wisdom of the past into the challenges that we face now. This refreshingly different guide explains philosophical fundamentals and explores some of the strangest and deepest questions ever posed to human beings, such as How do we know anything? What does the word good mean? Are we ever really free? Do human beings have souls? Is there life after death? Is there a God? Is happiness really possible in our world? This book is chock full of all those questions you may have long wanted to think about and talk with someone about, but have never had the time or opportunity to tackle head on. Philosophy For Dummies invites you to discuss the issues you find in the guide, share perspectives, and compare thoughts and feelings with someone you respect. You'll find lots of material to mull over with your friends or spouse, including thoughts on When to doubt, and when to doubt our doubts The universal demand for evidence and proof The four dimensions of human experience Arguments for materialism Fear of the process of dying Prayers and small miracles Moral justification for allowing evil The ancient philosopher Socrates (fifth century, B.C.) thought that, when it comes to the Ultimate Questions, we all start off as dummies. But if we are humbly aware of how little we actually know, then we can really begin to learn. Philosophy For Dummies will put you on the path to wising up as you steer through the experience called life.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781118053546"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1118053540"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":384,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Philosophy"],"averageRating":2.5,"ratingsCount":3,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.9.8.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Philosophy+for+Dummies&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC&rdid=book-8oLqdGQuoZEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Philosophy_For_Dummies-sample-epub.acsm?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Philosophy_For_Dummies-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8oLqdGQuoZEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In this refreshingly different guide, author Tom Morris not only explains philosophical fundamentals, but shows you how philosophy can help you find more meaning in life, understand religious belief, and look at the world in a whole new ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["nonFiction"],"title":"Philosophy for Dummies","hashCode":332564672,"goodReadsId":"11473342"},{"author":"Fleming, Ian","date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"yORSvQEACAAJ","etag":"Utq57ZxVF+Q","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yORSvQEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Casino Royale","authors":["Ian Fleming"],"publisher":"James Bond 007","publishedDate":"2012","description":"In order to rid the British Secret Service of \"Le Chiffre,\" a lethal Soviet operative with a weakness for gambling, James Bond is to bankrupt him in a French casino, but the secret agent's cards are not cooperating.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1612185436"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781612185439"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":178,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":3,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yORSvQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yORSvQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yORSvQEACAAJ&dq=Casino+Royale&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yORSvQEACAAJ&dq=Casino+Royale&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Casino_Royale.html?hl=&id=yORSvQEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yORSvQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In his first mission, agent 007, James Bond must neutralize a Russian agent known as &quot;Le Chiffre&quot;

From the moment she entered the world, Francie needed to be made of stern stuff, for the often harsh life of Williamsburg demanded fortitude, precocity, and strength of spirit. Often scorned by neighbors for her family’s erratic and eccentric behavior—such as her father Johnny’s taste for alcohol and Aunt Sissy’s habit of marrying serially without the formality of divorce—no one, least of all Francie, could say that the Nolans’ life lacked drama. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the Nolans’ daily experiences are tenderly threaded with family connectedness and raw with honesty. Betty Smith has, in the pages of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, captured the joys of humble Williamsburg life-from “junk day” on Saturdays, when the children of Francie’s neighborhood traded their weekly take for pennies, to the special excitement of holidays, bringing cause for celebration and revelry. Betty Smith has artfully caught this sense of exciting life in a novel of childhood, replete with incredibly rich moments of universal experiences—a truly remarkable achievement for any writer.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780061803024"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0061803022"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":528,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":227,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"3.12.12.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jalsLkb1GTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jalsLkb1GTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jalsLkb1GTUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Tree+Grows+in+Brooklyn&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jalsLkb1GTUC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jalsLkb1GTUC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jalsLkb1GTUC&rdid=book-jalsLkb1GTUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/A_Tree_Grows_in_Brooklyn-sample-epub.acsm?id=jalsLkb1GTUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jalsLkb1GTUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The American classic about a young girl&#39;s coming-of-age at the turn of the century.

K. Rowling. The book was released on 21 July 2007 by Bloomsbury Publishing in the United Kingdom, in the United States by Scholastic, and in Canada by Raincoast Books, ending the series that began in 1997 with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The novel chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005), and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007. Before its release, Bloomsbury reportedly spent 10 million to keep the book's contents safe before its release date. American publisher Arthur Levine refused any copies of the novel to be released in advance for press review, although two reviews were submitted early. Shortly before release, photos of all 759 pages of the U.S. edition were leaked and transcribed, leading Scholastic to look for the source that had leaked it. Released globally in 93 countries, Deathly Hallows broke sales records as the fastest-selling book ever, a record it still held in 2012.[3] It sold 15 million copies in the first 24 hours following its release, including more than 11 million in the U.S. and UK alone. The previous record, 9 million in its first day, had been held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The novel has also been translated into over 120 languages.\"","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1523480890"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781523480890"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":260,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":2,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&dq=Harry+Potter+and+the+Deathly+Hallows&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&dq=Harry+Potter+and+the+Deathly+Hallows&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=KXyNjwEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the seventh and final novel of the Harry Potter series, written by British author J.

The children come from many nations, many religions; while they are being trained for war, religious conflict between them is not on the curriculum. But Dink Meeker, one of the older students, doesn't see it that way. He thinks that giving gifts isn't exactly a religious observation, and on Sinterklaas Day he tucks a present into another student's shoe. This small act of rebellion sets off a battle royal between the students and the staff, but some surprising alliances form when Ender comes up against a new student, Zeck Morgan. The War over Santa Claus will force everyone to make a choice.

On the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives.

With all the power of his original creation, Ender's Shadow is Card's parallel volume to Ender's Game, a book that expands and complements the first, enhancing its power, illuminating its events and its powerful conclusion. The human race is at War with the \"Buggers\", an insect-like alien race. The first battles went badly, and now as Earth prepares to defend itself against the imminent threat of total destruction at the hands of an inscrutable alien enemy, all focus is on the development and training of military geniuses who can fight such a war, and win. The long distances of interstellar space have given hope to the defenders of Earth--they have time to train these future commanders up from childhood, forging then into an irresistible force in the high orbital facility called the Battle School. Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin was not the only child in the Battle School; he was just the best of the best. In this new book, card tells the story of another of those precocious generals, the one they called Bean--the one who became Ender's right hand, part of his team, in the final battle against the Buggers. Bean's past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else's. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Bean's desperate struggle to live, and his success, brought him to the attention of the Battle School's recruiters, those people scouring the planet for leaders, tacticians, and generals to save Earth from the threat of alien invasion. Bean was sent into orbit, to the Battle School. And there he met Ender....

For centuries, disease, hunger, poverty and war have been things found only in the histories. And applied genetics has given men and women the bodies of athletes and a lifespan of over a century. They should all have been very happy.... But Hamilton Felix is bored. And he is the culmination of a star line; each of his last thirty ancestors chosen for superior genes. Hamilton is, as far as genetics can produce one, the ultimate man. And this ultimate man can see no reason why the human race should survive, and has no intention of continuing the pointless comedy. However, Hamilton's life is about to become less boring. A secret cabal of revolutionaries who find utopia not just boring, but desperately in need of leaders who know just What Needs to be Done, are planning to revolt and put themselves in charge. Knowing of Hamilton's disenchantment with the modern world, they have recruited him to join their Glorious Revolution. Big mistake! The revolutionaries are about to find out that recruiting a superman is definitely not a good idea.... With an all new afterword by Tony Daniel.

Beginning in November 1944, they engaged the enemy for 183 straight days, spearheading many of Patton's offensives at the Battle of the Bulge and in six European countries. No other unit fought for so long and so hard without respite. The 761st defeated more than 6,000 enemy soldiers, captured thirty towns, liberated Jews from concentration camps -- and made history as the first African-American armored unit to enter the war. This is the true story of the Black Panthers, who proudly lived up to their motto (Come Out Fighting) and paved the way for African-Americans in the U.S. military -- while battling against the skepticism and racism of the very people they fought for.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1439103909"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781439103906"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":368,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.2.2.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ivLn50BfEzgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ivLn50BfEzgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ivLn50BfEzgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Patton%27s+Panthers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ivLn50BfEzgC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ivLn50BfEzgC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":15.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":15.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ivLn50BfEzgC&rdid=book-ivLn50BfEzgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":15990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":15990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Patton_s_Panthers-sample-epub.acsm?id=ivLn50BfEzgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ivLn50BfEzgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This is the true story of the Black Panthers, who proudly lived up to their motto (Come Out Fighting) and paved the way for African-Americans in the U.S. military -- while battling against the skepticism and racism of the very people they ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["history","military","nonFiction"],"title":"Patton's Panthers","hashCode":1364147047,"goodReadsId":"8100527"},{"author":"Sallah, Michael and Mitch Weiss","date":"2008-07-19T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"Lo2BHoIEXtAC","etag":"eB+gBAdG/LY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Lo2BHoIEXtAC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Tiger Force","subtitle":"A True Story of Men and War","authors":["Michael Sallah","Mitch Weiss"],"publisher":"Little, Brown","publishedDate":"2006-05-15","description":"At the outset of the Vietnam War, the Army created an experimental fighting unit that became known as \"Tiger Force.\" The Tigers were to be made up of the cream of the crop-the very best and bravest soldiers the American military could offer. They would be given a long leash, allowed to operate in the field with less supervision. Their mission was to seek out enemy compounds and hiding places so that bombing runs could be accurately targeted. They were to go where no troops had gone, to become one with the jungle, to leave themselves behind and get deep inside the enemy's mind. The experiment went terribly wrong. What happened during the seven months Tiger Force descended into the abyss is the stuff of nightmares. Their crimes were uncountable, their madness beyond imagination-so much so that for almost four decades, the story of Tiger Force was covered up under orders that stretched all the way to the White House. Records were scrubbed, documents were destroyed, men were told to say nothing.But one person didn't follow orders. The product of years of investigative reporting, interviews around the world, and the discovery of an astonishing array of classified information, Tiger Force is a masterpiece of journalism. Winners of the Pulitzer Prize for their Tiger Force reporting, Michael Sallah and Mitch Weiss have uncovered the last great secret of the Vietnam War.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780759515734"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0759515735"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":416,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":7,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.1.2.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lo2BHoIEXtAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lo2BHoIEXtAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lo2BHoIEXtAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tiger+Force&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lo2BHoIEXtAC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lo2BHoIEXtAC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lo2BHoIEXtAC&rdid=book-Lo2BHoIEXtAC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Tiger_Force-sample-epub.acsm?id=Lo2BHoIEXtAC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Lo2BHoIEXtAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Their crimes were uncountable, their madness beyond imagination-so much so that for almost four decades, the story of Tiger Force was covered up under orders that stretched all the way to the White House."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["history","military","nonFiction"],"title":"Tiger Force","hashCode":2042199050,"goodReadsId":"10131381"},{"author":"Tobin, James","date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"yTmyKpzQ2agC","etag":"RqNZDRWa5ko","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yTmyKpzQ2agC","volumeInfo":{"title":"To Conquer the Air","subtitle":"The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","authors":["James Tobin"],"publisher":"Simon and Schuster","publishedDate":"2012-06-12","description":"James Tobin, award-winning author of Ernie Pyle's War and The Man He Became, has penned the definitive account of the inspiring and impassioned race between the Wright brothers and their primary rival Samuel Langley across ten years and two continents to conquer the air. For years, Wilbur Wright and his younger brother, Orville, experimented in obscurity, supported only by their exceptional family. Meanwhile, the world watched as Samuel Langley, armed with a contract from the US War Department and all the resources of the Smithsonian Institution, sought to create the first manned flying machine. But while Langley saw flight as a problem of power, the Wrights saw a problem of balance. Thus their machines took two very different paths—Langley’s toward oblivion, the Wrights’ toward the heavens—though not before facing countless other obstacles. With a historian’s accuracy and a novelist’s eye, Tobin has captured an extraordinary moment in history. To Conquer the Air is itself a heroic achievement.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781439135495"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1439135495"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":448,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":3,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.15.11.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yTmyKpzQ2agC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yTmyKpzQ2agC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yTmyKpzQ2agC&printsec=frontcover&dq=To+Conquer+the+Air:+The+Wright+Brothers+and+the+Great+Race+for+Flight&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yTmyKpzQ2agC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yTmyKpzQ2agC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yTmyKpzQ2agC&rdid=book-yTmyKpzQ2agC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/To_Conquer_the_Air-sample-epub.acsm?id=yTmyKpzQ2agC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yTmyKpzQ2agC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"James Tobin, award-winning author of Ernie Pyle&#39;s War and The Man He Became, has penned the definitive account of the inspiring and impassioned race between the Wright brothers and their primary rival Samuel Langley across ten years and two ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["aviation","biography","history","nonFiction"],"title":"To Conquer the Air: The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight","hashCode":510525733,"goodReadsId":"15799904"},{"author":"Wood, Brian","date":"2008-08-21T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"26vJBAAAQBAJ","etag":"DU3aXHj609Y","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/26vJBAAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Placing America","subtitle":"American Culture and its Spaces","authors":["Michael Fuchs","Maria-Theresia Holub"],"publisher":"transcript Verlag","publishedDate":"2014-03-31","description":"In »Call Me Ishmael«, Charles Olson exclaims »SPACE to be the central fact to man born in America«.

With contributions that range from the construction of America in (European) academic discourses to children's fiction, this collection provides an extensive and insightful study of how space influences our understanding of America.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783839420805"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3839420806"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":214,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Language Arts & Disciplines"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.11.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA89&dq=DMZ:+The+Hidden+War&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":31.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":17.27,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-26vJBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":31990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":17270000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Placing_America-sample-pdf.acsm?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=26vJBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Richards, Dave (2005): »The War at Home: Wood and Burchielli Talk <b>DMZ</b>«, <br>\nComic Book Resources [online], 9 November, http://www.comicbookresources.<br>\ncom/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=6168. 2 December ... <b>DMZ</b> Vol. 5: The <b>Hidden War</b>."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["graphicNovel","fiction"],"title":"DMZ: The Hidden War","hashCode":1877513672,"goodReadsId":"20545546"},{"author":"Gaiman, Neil","date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"C8NVhWNU_uIC","etag":"HKHZMC2sfjE","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/C8NVhWNU_uIC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Coraline","authors":["Neil Gaiman"],"publisher":"A&C Black","publishedDate":"2009-11-02","description":"When a young girl ventures through a hidden door, she finds another life with shocking similarities to her own.

Do not buy this reading Sidekick if you are looking for a full copy of this great book.Use this expert sidekick to dissect these themes in Looking for Alaska, while enjoying a detailed analysis of each chapter of the book. If that wasn't enough, we close with potential questions and responses to help you get the conversation started with co-workers, friends, or fellow book club members.This newly discovered gem from the past (2005) has become a must-read, thanks in no small part to the success of Green's 2012 masterpiece: The Fault in Our Stars. As many Green fans have already discovered, our sidekick is the ultimate go-to source for understanding the complexities of John Green's tales of teen angst and tragedy. Looking for Alaska tells the story of Miles Halter, a 16-year-old with a nondescript life who is seeking a \"Great Perhaps.\" In his quest, he finds himself at the Culver Creek Boarding School, where his past life of boredom and safety takes a back seat to adventure and sexual experimentation.His trek to the other side of the tracks takes him only a few steps, as he meets Alaska Young just down the hall at school. She is sexy, funny, and everything else that makes teenage boys drool. She is also a self-destructive sort, headed toward the \"After\" portion of Looking for Alaska, where everything comes crashing down. As our sidekick details, the themes of life and death weave their way through the novel, drawing the characters closer together while preparing them for something that will rip them apart.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1497393035"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781497393035"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":58,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&dq=Looking+for+Alaska&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&dq=Looking+for+Alaska&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Looking_for_Alaska.html?hl=&id=5mKkoAEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5mKkoAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"WARNING: This is not the actual book Looking for Alaska by John Green.

Including chapters on the angelic authorship of The Urantia Book, Mary Baker Eddy's use of copyright to construct the Christian Science Church, interdenominational disputes in the Worldwide Church of God, and the Church of Scientology's landmark lawsuits against Internet service providers, this book examines how religious copyright owners mobilized the law in order to organize communities, protect sacred goods, produce new forms of spiritual identity, and even enchant the material world.

Most of the truly wealthy in the United States don’t live in Beverly Hills or on Park Avenue. They live next door. America’s wealthy seldom get that way through an inheritance or an advanced degree. They bargain-shop for used cars, raise children who don’t realize how rich their families are, and reject a lifestyle of flashy exhibitionism and competitive spending. In fact, the glamorous people many of us think of as “rich” are actually a tiny minority of America’s truly wealthy citizens—and behave quite differently than the majority. At the time of its first publication, The Millionaire Next Door was a groundbreaking examination of America’s rich—exposing for the first time the seven common qualities that appear over and over among this exclusive demographic. This edition includes a new foreword by Dr. Thomas J. Stanley—updating the original content in the context of the financial crash and the twenty-first century. “Their surprising results reveal fundamental qualities of this group that are diametrically opposed to today’s earn-and-consume culture.” —Library Journal","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780795314865"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0795314868"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":275,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Next&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":19.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DzytDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":19990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Millionaire_Next_Door-sample-epub.acsm?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Millionaire_Next_Door-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DzytDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This edition includes a new foreword by Dr. Thomas J.

K. Rowling. The book was released on 21 July 2007 by Bloomsbury Publishing in the United Kingdom, in the United States by Scholastic, and in Canada by Raincoast Books, ending the series that began in 1997 with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The novel chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005), and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007. Before its release, Bloomsbury reportedly spent 10 million to keep the book's contents safe before its release date. American publisher Arthur Levine refused any copies of the novel to be released in advance for press review, although two reviews were submitted early. Shortly before release, photos of all 759 pages of the U.S. edition were leaked and transcribed, leading Scholastic to look for the source that had leaked it. Released globally in 93 countries, Deathly Hallows broke sales records as the fastest-selling book ever, a record it still held in 2012.[3] It sold 15 million copies in the first 24 hours following its release, including more than 11 million in the U.S. and UK alone. The previous record, 9 million in its first day, had been held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The novel has also been translated into over 120 languages.\"","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1523480890"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781523480890"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":260,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":2,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&dq=Harry+Potter+and+the+Deathly+Hallows&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&dq=Harry+Potter+and+the+Deathly+Hallows&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=KXyNjwEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KXyNjwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the seventh and final novel of the Harry Potter series, written by British author J.

captures readers with this fast-paced and imaginative story ignited when the Russians announce a manned mission to the moon. Air Force Colonel Brandt Strickland, a member of a Pentagon group studying the Russian plan, is certain that the Americans must be on the moon first and that we have less than two years to get there. At stake is control of the world's energy supply. But he has no spacecraft, no crew, and a President vehemently opposed to his mission. The Moon War follows Strickland through the triumphs and tragedies of his incredible odyssey. The story volleys between America and Russia as the countries scramble to launch. Greed, corruption and deception, even at the very highest levels, cause the plot to twist and turn as the tension mounts. With extraordinary technical accuracy, Davey's story assembles a cast of astronauts, cosmonauts, politicians and engineers drawn from real life who react to the unending trials with uncanny realism. Reflecting Davey's experiences as an Air Force officer, an engineer, and an educator, The Moon War tells a tale that may well fill the pages of tomorrow's newspapers.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1480187216"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781480187214"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":376,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&dq=Moon+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&dq=Moon+War&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Moon_War.html?hl=&id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Xlc8mgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The Moon War follows Strickland through the triumphs and tragedies of his incredible odyssey.

Dick's final trilogy (followed by The Divine Invasion andThe Transmigration of Timothy Archer), VALIS encapsulates many of the themes that Dick was obsessed with over the course of his career. A disorienting and bleakly funny novel,VALIS (which stands for Vast Active Living Intelligence System) is about a schizophrenic man named Horselover Fat (who just might also be known as Philip Dick); the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity; and reality as revealed through a pink laser.VALIS is a theological detective story, in which God is both a missing person and the perpetrator of the ultimate crime. Taking place in the same universe as Dick's soon-to-be-published Exegesis,VALIS is a dense novel, but one that is absolutely essential to understanding the author's off-kilter worldview. Much like Dick himself, the reader is left wondering what is real, what is fiction, and what the price is for divine inspiration.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780547572413"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0547572417"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":271,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":28,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Valis&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&dq=Valis&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Valis.html?hl=&id=1V9_sv_BudkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1V9_sv_BudkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Horselover Fat begins receiving what he considers to be divine revelations that imply extraterrestrial forces are interfering in the affairs of the Earth."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["sciFi","fiction"],"title":"Valis","hashCode":82419691,"goodReadsId":"43713932"},{"author":"Scalzi, John","date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"GwI3Sj_pwsUC","etag":"PRfi+U46ccc","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GwI3Sj_pwsUC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Last Colony","authors":["John Scalzi"],"publisher":"Tor Books","publishedDate":"2007-04-17","description":"Retired from his fighting days, John Perry is now village ombudsman for a human colony on distant Huckleberry.

They're young, they're fast and strong, and they're totally without normal human qualms. The universe is a dangerous place for humanity—and it's about to become far more dangerous. Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows the CDF's biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did. Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers -- a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's DNA, Jared's brain should be able to access Boutin's electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost Brigades. At first, Jared is a perfect soldier, but as Boutin's memories slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit the reason's for Boutin's betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his \"father,\" he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: The alliance is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity's mere military defeat...

minds and lives since it burst onto the literary scene, The Things They Carried is a ground-breaking meditation on war, memory, imagination, and the redemptive power of storytelling. The Things They Carried depicts the men of Alpha Company: Jimmy Cross, Henry Dobbins, Rat Kiley, Mitchell Sanders, Norman Bowker, Kiowa, and the character Tim O’Brien, who has survived his tour in Vietnam to become a father and writer at the age of forty-three. Taught everywhere—from high school classrooms to graduate seminars in creative writing—it has become required reading for any American and continues to challenge readers in their perceptions of fact and fiction, war and peace, courage and fear and longing. The Things They Carried won France's prestigious Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize; it was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780547420295"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0547420293"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":47,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.7.7.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Things+They+Carried&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C&rdid=book-Op6eKrkxPq4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Things_They_Carried-sample-epub.acsm?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Things_They_Carried-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Op6eKrkxPq4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The Things They Carried won France&#39;s prestigious Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize; it was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["classics","fiction","military"],"title":"The Things They Carried","hashCode":1410644610,"goodReadsId":"7762798"},{"author":"Haldeman, Joe","date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"_Y1o4cXZFfQC","etag":"KEi++Nv6fDY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_Y1o4cXZFfQC","volumeInfo":{"title":"A Separate War and Other Stories","authors":["Joe Haldeman"],"publisher":"Penguin","publishedDate":"2006-08-01","description":"6 years of stories from the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author.

Since 2003, Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead has been redefining the survival horror genre with its unique and vivid account of life after the end of the world. Although the cast is diverse and often changing (including, of course, a great number of zombies), at the heart of every tale is Rick Grimes: former police officer, husband, father, and de facto leader of a ragtag band of survivors looking to make a future for themselves in a world that no longer has one. To call The Walking Dead a zombie tale is accurate to a point, but it touches on only one facet of a story that asks timeless questions about what it means to live. It also asks whether or not this is possible in a world full of the dead.

New York Times best-selling author Neil Gaiman's transcendent series THE SANDMAN is often hailed as the definitive Vertigo title and one of the finest achievements in graphic storytelling. Gaiman created an unforgettable tale of the forces that exist beyond life and death by weaving ancient mythology, folklore and fairy tales with his own distinct narrative vision. In PRELUDES & NOCTURNES, an occultist attempting to capture Death to bargain for eternal life traps her younger brother Dream instead. After his 70 year imprisonment and eventual escape, Dream, also known as Morpheus, goes on a quest for his lost objects of power. On his arduous journey Morpheus encounters Lucifer, John Constantine, and an all-powerful madman.

During Morpheus's incarceration, three dreams escaped the Dreaming and are now loose in the waking world. At the same time, a young woman named Rose Walker is searching for her little brother.

Through breakdowns, prison, war, revolutions, disasters and a Californian commune, he travelled into the depths of fear and reached the heights of euphoria. He met astonishing people and was treated as a spy, a welcome stranger and even a god. For Simon the trip became a journey into his own soul, and for many others - including bikers Charley Boorman and Ewan McGrergor - it provides an inspiration they will never forget. This classic text, which has informed a whole genre of travel writing in the thirty years since it was first published, will never be bettered for sheer adventure, passion, humour and honesty. Brought up in England by a German mother and a Romanian father, Ted Simon found himself impelled by an insatiable desire to explore the world. It led him to abandon an early scientific career in favour of journalism, and he has worked for several newspapers and magazines on Fleet Street and elsewhere. Ted Simon is also the author of Riding Home and The Gypsy in Me.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780141929293"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0141929294"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":464,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Travel"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":4,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.11.13.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mp4i9AingcgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mp4i9AingcgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mp4i9AingcgC&dq=Jupiter%27s+Travels&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mp4i9AingcgC&dq=Jupiter%27s+Travels&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Jupiter_s_Travels.html?hl=&id=Mp4i9AingcgC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Mp4i9AingcgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Jupiter&#39;s Travels -Ted Simon&#39;s astonishing 4 year motorbike journey around the world The book that inspired Ewan McGregor&#39;s Long Way Round In the late 1970s Ted Simon set off on a Triumph and rode 63,000 miles over four years through fifty ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["memoir","nonFiction","travel"],"title":"Jupiter's Travels","hashCode":1195557310,"goodReadsId":"19013591"},{"author":"Gaiman, Neil","date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"DUatKAAACAAJ","etag":"o3i2CLjUcdw","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DUatKAAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Sandman","subtitle":"A Game of You","authors":["Neil Gaiman"],"publishedDate":"1993","description":"This title has a motley crew of a drag queen, a punky lesbian couple, several talking animals, one talking decapitated head, the confused heroine Barbie and, of course.

D-Day - the beginning of the Allied invasion of Hitler's formidable 'Fortress Europe' - was the largest amphibious invasion in history. There has never been a battle like it, before or since. But beyond the statistics and over sixty years on, what is it about the events of D-Day that remain so compelling? The courage of the men who fought and died on the beaches of France? The sheer boldness of the invasion plan? Or the fact that this, Rommel's 'longest day', heralded the beginning of the end of World War II. One of the defining battles of the war, D-Day is scored into the imagination as the moment when the darkness of the Third Reich began to be swept away. This is the story of D-Day, told through the voices of over 1,000 survivors - from high-ranking Allied and German officers, to the paratroopers who landed in Normandy before dawn, the infantry who struggled ashore and the German troops who defended the coast.Cornelius Ryan captures the horror and the glory of D-Day, relating in emotive and compelling detail the years of inspired tactical planning that led up to the invasion, its epic implementation and every stroke of luck and individual act of heroism that would later define the battle.In the words of its author, The Longest Day is a story not of war, but of the courage of man.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1838603441"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781838603441"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":3,"ratingsCount":7,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fHMCwgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fHMCwgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fHMCwgEACAAJ&dq=The+Longest+Day&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fHMCwgEACAAJ&dq=The+Longest+Day&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Longest_Day.html?hl=&id=fHMCwgEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fHMCwgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This is the story of D-Day, told through the voices of over 1,000 survivors - from high-ranking Allied and German officers, to the paratroopers who landed in Normandy before dawn, the infantry who struggled ashore and the German troops who ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["history","military"],"title":"The Longest Day","hashCode":1740517769,"goodReadsId":"51042469"},{"author":"Gaiman, Neil","date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"5gCfDwAAQBAJ","etag":"+FuuLBUnHKc","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/5gCfDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Sandman Vol. 9: The Kindly Ones 30th Anniversary Edition","authors":["Neil Gaiman"],"publisher":"Vertigo","publishedDate":"2019-07-02","description":"In the longest-ever SANDMAN story, Morpheus becomes the prey of the Furies—avenging spirits who torment those who spill family blood.

A Bridge Too Far is Cornelius Ryan's masterly chronicle of the Battle of Arnhem, which marshalled the greatest armada of troop-carrying aircraft ever assembled and cost the Allies nearly twice as many casualties as D-Day. In this compelling work of history, Ryan narrates the Allied effort to end the war in Europe in 1944 by dropping the combined airborne forces of the American and British armies behind German lines to capture the crucial bridge across the Rhine at Arnhem. Focusing on a vast cast of characters—from Dutch civilians to British and American strategists to common soldiers and commanders—Ryan brings to life one of the most daring and ill-fated operations of the war. A Bridge Too Far superbly recreates the terror and suspense, the heroism and tragedy of this epic operation, which ended in bitter defeat for the Allies.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781439126714"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1439126712"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":672,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.16.15.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Bridge+Too+Far&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC&rdid=book-8m4HNeMBWqwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/A_Bridge_Too_Far-sample-epub.acsm?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In

It remains an undisputed classic, one of the most influential stories ever told in comics, and is a book cited by the filmmakers as an inspiration for the most recent Batman movies. It is ten years after an aging Batman has retired and Gotham City has sunk deeper into decadence and lawlessness. Now, as his city needs him most, the Dark Knight returns in a blaze of glory. Joined by Carrie Kelly, a teenage female Robin, Batman takes to the streets to end the threat of the mutant gangs that have overrun the city. And after facing off against his two greatest enemies, the Joker and Two-Face, for the final time, Batman finds himself in mortal combat with his former ally, Superman, in a battle that only one of them will survive. This collection is hailed as a comics masterpiece and was responsible for the launch of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies.

The story of Abe's origins unfolds as the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense try to stop the monstrous frog men from the first Hellboy graphic novel, Seed of Destruction. The plague begins its spread across America, lending an apocalyptic new direction to Mignola's stories. • Collects the five-issue miniseries. • With art by Guy Davis and a behind-the-scenes look at his sketchbook, this third volume of B.P.R.D. sees Mignola taking over writing chores for the first time and reveals secrets he's kept under wraps since the beginning of the Hellboy saga, and changes that world completely.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781621150015"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1621150011"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":144,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Comics & Graphic Novels"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.3.2.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":true,"containsImageBubbles":true,"epubBubbleVersion":"83413bb79d2db157_A","imageBubbleVersion":"83413bb79d2db157_A"},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=voOX8RvyJmsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=voOX8RvyJmsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=voOX8RvyJmsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=B.P.R.D.+2:+The+Soul+of+Venice+and+and+Other+Stories&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=voOX8RvyJmsC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=voOX8RvyJmsC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=voOX8RvyJmsC&rdid=book-voOX8RvyJmsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/B_P_R_D_Volume_2_The_Soul_of_Venice_and-sample-epub.acsm?id=voOX8RvyJmsC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/B_P_R_D_Volume_2_The_Soul_of_Venice_and-sample-pdf.acsm?id=voOX8RvyJmsC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=voOX8RvyJmsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The plague begins its spread across America, lending an apocalyptic new direction to Mignola&#39;s stories. • Collects the five-issue miniseries. • With art by Guy Davis and a behind-the-scenes look at his sketchbook, this third volume of B ..."}},"notes":null,"review":0,"tags":["graphicNovel"],"title":"B.P.R.D. 2: The Soul of Venice and and Other Stories","hashCode":1732997712,"goodReadsId":null},{"author":"Mignola, Mike","date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"DINtAAAACAAJ","etag":"cmdJe7TeLSI","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DINtAAAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"B.P.R.D.

The children come from many nations, many religions; while they are being trained for war, religious conflict between them is not on the curriculum. But Dink Meeker, one of the older students, doesn't see it that way. He thinks that giving gifts isn't exactly a religious observation, and on Sinterklaas Day he tucks a present into another student's shoe. This small act of rebellion sets off a battle royal between the students and the staff, but some surprising alliances form when Ender comes up against a new student, Zeck Morgan. The War over Santa Claus will force everyone to make a choice.

On August 5, 1942, giant pillars of dust rose over the Russian steppe, marking the advance of the 6th Army, an elite German combat unit dispatched by Hitler to capture the industrial city of Stalingrad and press on to the oil fields of Azerbaijan. The Germans were supremely confident; in three years, they had not suffered a single defeat.The Luftwaffe had already bombed the city into ruins. German soldiers hoped to complete their mission and be home in time for Christmas. The siege of Stalingrad lasted five months, one week, and three days. Nearly two million men and women died, and the 6th Army was completely destroyed. Considered by many historians to be the turning point of World War II in Europe, the Soviet Army’s victory foreshadowed Hitler’s downfall and the rise of a communist superpower. Bestselling author William Craig spent five years researching this epic clash of military titans, traveling to three continents in order to review documents and interview hundreds of survivors. Enemy at the Gates is the enthralling result: the definitive account of one of the most important battles in world history. It became a New York Times bestseller and was also the inspiration for the 2001 film of the same name, starring Joseph Fiennes and Jude Law.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781504021340"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1504021347"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":457,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":11,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.28.27.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Enemy+at+the+Gates:The+Battle+for+Stalingrad&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":19.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.33,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":19990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11330000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true},{"finskyOfferType":3,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":2690000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"rentalDuration":{"unit":"DAY","count":3}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Enemy_at_the_Gates-sample-epub.acsm?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Enemy_at_the_Gates-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Enemy at the Gates is the enthralling result: the definitive account of one of the most important battles in world history."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["history","military","nonFiction"],"title":"Enemy at the Gates:The Battle for Stalingrad","hashCode":521652825,"goodReadsId":"26084964"},{"author":"Edited by Adams, John Joseph","date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"j74R0bdemScC","etag":"rezeF/9TgHY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/j74R0bdemScC","volumeInfo":{"title":"4th Armored Division in World War II","authors":["George Forty"],"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781616732646"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1616732644"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"printType":"BOOK","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.0.0.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j74R0bdemScC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j74R0bdemScC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j74R0bdemScC&pg=PA17&dq=Armored&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j74R0bdemScC&dq=Armored&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/4th_Armored_Division_in_World_War_II.html?hl=&id=j74R0bdemScC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/4th_Armored_Division_in_World_War_II-sample-pdf.acsm?id=j74R0bdemScC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=j74R0bdemScC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"During World War II, the U.S. <b>armored</b> division had no fewer than six different <br>\norganizations (TO&amp;E or Tables of Organization &amp;

Indeed, it was the Panzers' achievements in battle that were largely responsible for Germany's early run of success in the Second World War and, once the tide of war began to turn against the Reich, the Panzers subsequently became the backbone of its defence. The dramatic story of Hitler's tank divisions is brought to life in this authoritative narrative. Panzerkrieg vividly describes the evolution, exploits and eventual destruction of this superlative fighting force in immensely readable fashion. Particularly accessible to the general reader who wants to know more about Germany's Second World War tank forces, the authors dispense with technical jargon and pedantic detail to give a comprehensive overview of all aspects of the subject, both human and technical. The book gives particular emphasis to the men who fought in and led the Panzer divisions: great generals like Guderian, Rommel and Manstein, tank masters like Wittmann and Bake, and inspired commanders like Balck and Bayerlein. The whole vast canvas of the war emerges from this narrative, as it follows the titanic struggles which ranged between the bocage country of France, the desert wastes of North Africa, and the limitless steppes of Russia. The evolution of German fighting vehicles and tactics is fully charted, and the many myths, fallacies and misconceptions that have grown up around the Panzerwaffe are exploded. Extensive research, reference to the memoirs of the leading participants, and original new conclusions all contribute to a comprehensive account that critically examines the achievements, failures, and ultimate legacy of the Panzer divisions.

A STORM OF SWORDS Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King’s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. . . . But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords. . . .","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"055389787X"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780553897876"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":992,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":277,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.44.38.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Storm+of+Swords&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC&rdid=book-rIj5x-C7D2cC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/A_Storm_of_Swords-sample-epub.acsm?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/A_Storm_of_Swords-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rIj5x-C7D2cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"THE BOOK BEHIND THE THIRD SEASON OF GAME OF THRONES, AN ORIGINAL SERIES NOW ON HBO.

It’s 1955 and British journalist Thomas Fowler has been in Vietnam for two years covering the insurgency against French colonial rule. But it’s not just a political tangle that’s kept him tethered to the country. There’s also his lover, Phuong, a young Vietnamese woman who clings to Fowler for protection. Then comes Alden Pyle, an idealistic American working in service of the CIA. Devotedly, disastrously patriotic, he believes neither communism nor colonialism is what’s best for Southeast Asia, but rather a “Third Force”: American democracy by any means necessary. His ideas of conquest include Phuong, to whom he promises a sweet life in the states. But as Pyle’s blind moral conviction wreaks havoc upon innocent lives, it’s ultimately his romantic compulsions that will play a role in his own undoing. Although criticized upon publication as anti-American, Graham Greene’s “complex but compelling story of intrigue and counter-intrigue” would, in a few short years, prove prescient in its own condemnation of American interventionism (The New York Times).","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781504052542"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1504052544"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":180,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":3,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.13.11.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Quiet+American&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":21.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":12.47,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-C8VQDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":21990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":12470000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Quiet_American-sample-epub.acsm?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Quiet_American-sample-pdf.acsm?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=C8VQDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Although criticized upon publication as anti-American, Graham Greene’s “complex but compelling story of intrigue and counter-intrigue” would, in a few short years, prove prescient in its own condemnation of American interventionism ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["classics","fiction"],"title":"The Quiet American","hashCode":1327874949,"goodReadsId":"39295981"},{"author":"Schivelbusch, Wolfgang","date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"YzuJAwAAQBAJ","etag":"sSnbnZTxg4U","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YzuJAwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Railway Journey","subtitle":"The Industrialization of Time and Space in the Nineteenth Century","authors":["Wolfgang Schivelbusch"],"publisher":"Univ of California Press","publishedDate":"2014-05-06","description":"The impact of constant technological change upon our perception of the world is so pervasive as to have become a commonplace of modern society. But this was not always the case; as Wolfgang Schivelbusch points out in this fascinating study, our adaptation to technological change—the development of our modern, industrialized consciousness—was very much a learned behavior. In The Railway Journey, Schivelbusch examines the origins of this industrialized consciousness by exploring the reaction in the nineteenth century to the first dramatic avatar of technological change, the railroad. In a highly original and engaging fashion, Schivelbusch discusses the ways in which our perceptions of distance, time, autonomy, speed, and risk were altered by railway travel. As a history of the surprising ways in which technology and culture interact, this book covers a wide range of topics, including the changing perception of landscapes, the death of conversation while traveling, the problematic nature of the railway compartment, the space of glass architecture, the pathology of the railway journey, industrial fatigue and the history of shock, and the railroad and the city. Belonging to a distinguished European tradition of critical sociology best exemplified by the work of Georg Simmel and Walter Benjamin, The Railway Journey is anchored in rich empirical data and full of striking insights about railway travel, the industrial revolution, and technological change. Now updated with a new preface, The Railway Journey is an invaluable resource for readers interested in nineteenth-century culture and technology and the prehistory of modern media and digitalization.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780520957909"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0520957903"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":248,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Social Science"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"2.4.4.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Railway+Journey&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":31.95,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":17.25,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YzuJAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":31950000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":17250000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Railway_Journey-sample-epub.acsm?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Railway_Journey-sample-pdf.acsm?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YzuJAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"As a history of the surprising ways in which technology and culture interact, this book covers a wide range of topics, including the changing perception of landscapes, the death of conversation while traveling, the problematic nature of the ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["history","nonFiction"],"title":"The Railway Journey","hashCode":1314165074,"goodReadsId":"21877053"},{"author":"Dick, Philip K.","date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"5aBwki0xmZEC","etag":"nPvCM9CVLoc","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/5aBwki0xmZEC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Man in the High Castle","authors":["Philip K.

In “Autofac,” one community must battle benign machines to take back control of their lives. And in “I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon,” we follow the story of one man whose very reality may be nothing more than a nightmare. The collection also includes such classic stories as “The Minority Report,” the basis for the Steven Spielberg movie, and “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,” the basis for the film Total Recall.

Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck: “scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed…and, at the darkest level…the terror of isolation and nothingness.” For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Just as that novel brought us a brilliant Hell that only he could imagine, Doomed is a dark and twisted apocalyptic vision from this provocative storyteller. The bestselling Damned chronicled Madison’s journey across the unspeakable (and really gross) landscape of the afterlife to confront the Devil himself. But her story isn’t over yet. In a series of electronic dispatches from the Great Beyond, Doomed describes the ultimate showdown between Good and Evil. After a Halloween ritual gone awry, Madison finds herself trapped in Purgatory—or, as mortals like you and I know it, Earth. She can see and hear every detail of the world she left behind, yet she’s invisible to everyone who’s still alive. Not only do people look right through her, they walk right through her as well. The upside is that, no longer subject to physical limitations, she can pass through doors and walls. Her first stop is her parents’ luxurious apartment, where she encounters the ghost of her long-deceased grandmother. For Madison, the encounter triggers memories of the awful summer she spent upstate with Nana Minnie and her grandfather, Papadaddy. As she revisits the painful truth of what transpired over those months (including a disturbing and finally fatal meeting in a rest stop’s fetid men’s room, in which . . . well, never mind), her saga of eternal damnation takes on a new and sinister meaning. Satan has had Madison in his sights from the very beginning: through her and her narcissistic celebrity parents, he plans to engineer an era of eternal damnation. For everyone. Once again, our unconventional but plucky heroine must face her fears and gather her wits for the battle of a lifetime. Dante Alighieri, watch your back; Chuck Palahniuk is gaining on you.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780385533157"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0385533152"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":2.5,"ratingsCount":11,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.9.9.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6yRbsPXQYY4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6yRbsPXQYY4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6yRbsPXQYY4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Doomed&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6yRbsPXQYY4C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6yRbsPXQYY4C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6yRbsPXQYY4C&rdid=book-6yRbsPXQYY4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Doomed-sample-epub.acsm?id=6yRbsPXQYY4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6yRbsPXQYY4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Just as that novel brought us a brilliant Hell that only he could imagine, Doomed is a dark and twisted apocalyptic vision from this provocative storyteller."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["graphicNovel","fiction"],"title":"Doomed","hashCode":2052707880,"goodReadsId":"18666195"},{"author":"Boom Town Comics, Various Authors","date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"fNk0tgEACAAJ","etag":"/2CoQ+tGdNo","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fNk0tgEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Cbgb And Omfug Thirty Years From The Home Of Under","authors":["Hilly Kristal"],"publishedDate":"2006-08","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0810970813"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780810970816"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":34,"printType":"BOOK","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fNk0tgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fNk0tgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fNk0tgEACAAJ&dq=CBGB:+OMFUG&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fNk0tgEACAAJ&dq=CBGB:+OMFUG&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Cbgb_And_Omfug_Thirty_Years_From_The_Hom.html?hl=&id=fNk0tgEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fNk0tgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["graphicNovel","fiction"],"title":"CBGB: OMFUG","hashCode":286531738,"goodReadsId":"43662117"},{"author":"Gaiman, Neil","date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"uenPAQAAQBAJ","etag":"RwP5Reqh/Jo","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/uenPAQAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Death: The Deluxe Edition","authors":["Neil Gaiman"],"publisher":"DC","publishedDate":"2012-10-09","description":"A New York Times Best Seller!

Lanie Price, a Harlem society columnist, witnesses the brutal nightclub kidnapping of the “Black Orchid,” a sultry, seductive singer with a mysterious past. When hours pass without a word from the kidnapper, puzzlement grows as to his motive. After a gruesome package arrives at Price’s doorstep, the questions change. Just what does the kidnapper want—and how many people is he willing to kill to get it? Evil hides behind the genteel facades of affluent Strivers’ Row, and stalks the ballroom of a famous drag party, in this “dark, sexy” mystery set during the Harlem Renaissance (Publishers Weekly). “Lanie has the makings of a strong series heroine.

The difference between the well-ordered Union air fields and this dusty garrison is made painfully clear when she runs afoul a brutal commander of ground troops. While trapped behind enemy lines during a bloody uprising she meets Djari, a human civilian whose trust in the governing Union is shattered by what he has witnessed. Indeed, not everything out here seems to run according to protocol and Nova soon suspects that more than farming is being done aboard the Skyranch.

Since 2003, Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead has been redefining the survival horror genre with its unique and vivid account of life after the end of the world. Although the cast is diverse and often changing (including, of course, a great number of zombies), at the heart of every tale is Rick Grimes: former police officer, husband, father, and de facto leader of a ragtag band of survivors looking to make a future for themselves in a world that no longer has one. To call The Walking Dead a zombie tale is accurate to a point, but it touches on only one facet of a story that asks timeless questions about what it means to live. It also asks whether or not this is possible in a world full of the dead.

Whether I am bathing in my martini glass, riding my sparkling carousel horse, or emerging from my giant gold powder compact, I live out my most glamorous fantasies by bringing nostalgic imagery to life. Let me show you my world of gorgeous pin-ups, tantalizing stripteases, and femmes fatales. I'll give you a glimpse into my life, but a lady never reveals all. Fetish and the Art of the Teese You may have come for the fetish. Or you may just be sneaking a peek at this mysterious and peculiar other side. No matter what you've come for, there is something for you to indulge in. My world of fetish may not be the one that you would expect. As a burlesque performer, I entice my audience, bringing their minds closer and closer to sex and then -- as good temptress must -- snatching it away. As a fetish star, I apply the same techniques. . . . An opera-length kid leather glove, a strict wasp waist, an impossibly high patent leather heel, a severely painted red lip. . . .

Clarke’s writing for decades. With Time’s Eye and Sunstorm, the first two books in their acclaimed Time Odyssey series, Clarke and his brilliant co-author Stephen Baxter imagined a near-future in which the Firstborn seek to stop the advance of human civilization by employing a technology indistinguishable from magic. Their first act was the Discontinuity, in which Earth was carved into sections from different eras of history, restitched into a patchwork world, and renamed Mir. Mir’s inhabitants included such notables as Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and United Nations peacekeeper Bisesa Dutt. For reasons unknown to her, Bisesa entered into communication with an alien artifact of inscrutable purpose and godlike power–a power that eventually returned her to Earth. There, she played an instrumental role in humanity’s race against time to stop a doomsday event: a massive solar storm triggered by the alien Firstborn designed to eradicate all life from the planet. That fate was averted at an inconceivable price. Now, twenty-seven years later, the Firstborn are back. This time, they are pulling no punches: They have sent a “quantum bomb.” Speeding toward Earth, it is a device that human scientists can barely comprehend, that cannot be stopped or destroyed–and one that will obliterate Earth.

'Possibly Gaiman's most lyrical, scary and beautiful work yet. It's a tale of childhood for grown-ups, a fantasy rooted in the darkest corners of reality' (Independent on Sunday). If you loved the mesmerising world of Erin Morgenstern's The Night Circus or were drawn into J.K. Rowling's magical universe, this book is for you. It began for our narrator forty years ago when the family lodger stole their car and committed suicide in it, stirring up ancient powers best left undisturbed. Dark creatures from beyond this world are on the loose, and it will take everything our narrator has just to stay alive: there is primal horror here, and menace unleashed - within his family and from the forces that have gathered to destroy it. His only defence is three women, on a farm at the end of the lane. The youngest of them claims that her duckpond is an ocean. The oldest can remember the Big Bang. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a fable that reshapes modern fantasy: moving, terrifying and elegiac - as pure as a dream, as delicate as a butterfly's wing, as dangerous as a knife in the dark.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781472200334"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1472200330"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":143,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Design"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":2,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.8.12.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L9fpff1b4kwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L9fpff1b4kwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L9fpff1b4kwC&dq=The+Ocean+at+the+End+of+the+Lane&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L9fpff1b4kwC&dq=The+Ocean+at+the+End+of+the+Lane&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ocean_at_the_End_of_the_Lane.html?hl=&id=L9fpff1b4kwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=L9fpff1b4kwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"WINNER OF THE SPECSAVERS NATIONAL BOOK AWARDS 2013 BOOK OF THE YEAR The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the bestselling magical novel from Neil Gaiman, one of the most brilliant storytellers of our generation and author of the epic novel ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["fantasy","horror","fiction"],"title":"The Ocean at the End of the Lane","hashCode":1020516980,"goodReadsId":"18102832"},{"author":"Mitchell, David","date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"EoxXLiC0uAIC","etag":"vpL1Gw6vcpE","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EoxXLiC0uAIC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Cloud Atlas","authors":["David Mitchell"],"publisher":"Vintage Canada","publishedDate":"2010-07-16","description":"By the New York Times bestselling author of The Bone Clocks | Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize A postmodern visionary and one of the leading voices in twenty-first-century fiction, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian love of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending, philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profound as it is playful. In this groundbreaking novel, an influential favorite among a new generation of writers, Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity. Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . . Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history. But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky. As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon. Praise for Cloud Atlas “[David] Mitchell is, clearly, a genius. He writes as though at the helm of some perpetual dream machine, can evidently do anything, and his ambition is written in magma across this novel’s every page.”—The New York Times Book Review “One of those how-the-holy-hell-did-he-do-it? modern classics that no doubt is—and should be—read by any student of contemporary literature.”—Dave Eggers “Wildly entertaining . . . a head rush, both action-packed and chillingly ruminative.”—People “The novel as series of nested dolls or Chinese boxes, a puzzle-book, and yet—not just dazzling, amusing, or clever but heartbreaking and passionate, too. I’ve never read anything quite like it, and I’m grateful to have lived, for a while, in all its many worlds.”—Michael Chabon “Cloud Atlas ought to make [Mitchell] famous on both sides of the Atlantic as a writer whose fearlessness is matched by his talent.”—The Washington Post Book World “Thrilling . . . One of the biggest joys in Cloud Atlas is watching Mitchell sashay from genre to genre without a hitch in his dance step.”—Boston Sunday Globe “Grand and elaborate . . . [Mitchell] creates a world and language at once foreign and strange, yet strikingly familiar and intimate.”—Los Angeles Times From the Hardcover

At thirty-seven Medgar Evers, field secretary for the Mississippi NAACP, died in a horrifying act of political violence. Outside his home, in the summer of 1963, he was gunned down by a midnight assassin. This memoir by an extraordinary woman tells a moving story of her courtship and marriage and of her husband's unrelenting devotion to the quest of achieving civil rights for thousands of black Mississippians. Readers of Myrlie Evers's story will note an aching piece of irony. Her husband's tragic martyrdom quickened the pace of justice for black people while withholding it from him for thirty years.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0878058419"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780878058419"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":378,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.2.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=739CkrdEP2IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=739CkrdEP2IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=739CkrdEP2IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=For+Us,+the+Living&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=739CkrdEP2IC&dq=For+Us,+the+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/For_Us_the_Living.html?hl=&id=739CkrdEP2IC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=739CkrdEP2IC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Her husband&#39;s tragic martyrdom quickened the pace of justice for black people while withholding it from him for thirty years.

It's a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship's Xenobiology laboratory. Life couldn't be better...until Andrew begins to pick up on the fact that (1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces, (2) the ship's captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations, and (3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed. Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expendedon avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission. Then Andrew stumbles on information that completely transforms his and his colleagues' understanding of what the starship Intrepid really is...and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.

The people of Earth now know that the human Colonial Union has kept them ignorant of the dangerous universe around them. For generations the CU had defended humanity against hostile aliens, deliberately keeping Earth an ignorant backwater and a source of military recruits. Now the CU's secrets are known to all. Other alien races have come on the scene and formed a new alliance—an alliance against the Colonial Union. And they've invited the people of Earth to join them. For a shaken and betrayed Earth, the choice isn't obvious or easy. Against such possibilities, managing the survival of the Colonial Union won't be easy, either. It will take diplomatic finesse, political cunning...and a brilliant \"B Team,\" centered on the resourceful Lieutenant Harry Wilson, that can be deployed to deal with the unpredictable and unexpected things the universe throws at you when you're struggling to preserve the unity of the human race. Being published online from January to April 2013 as a three-month digital serial, The Human Division will appear as a full-length novel of the Old Man's War universe, plus—for the first time in print—the first tale of Lieutenant Harry Wilson, and a coda that wasn't part of the digital serialization.

Tucker"],"publisher":"Univ. Press of Mississippi","publishedDate":"2007","description":"Lockstep and Dance: Images of Black Men in Popular Culture examines popular culture's reliance on long-standing stereotypes of black men as animalistic, hypersexual, dangerous criminals, whose bodies, dress, actions, attitudes, and language both repel and attract white audiences. Author Linda G. Tucker studies this trope in the images of well-known African American men in four cultural venues: contemporary literature, black-focused films, sports commentary, and rap music. Through rigorous analysis, the book argues that American popular culture's representations of black men preserve racial hierarchies that imprison blacks both intellectually and physically. Of equal importance are the ways in which black men battle against, respond to, and become implicated in the production and circulation of these images. Tucker cites examples ranging from Michael Jordan's underwear commercials and the popular Barbershop movies, to the career of rapper Tupac Shakur and John Edgar Wideman's memoir Brothers and Keepers . Lockstep and Dance tracks the continuity between historical images of African American men, the peculiar constitution of whites' anxieties about black men, and black men's tolerance of and resistance to the reproduction of such images. The legacy of these stereotypes is still apparent in contemporary advertising, film, music, and professional basketball. Lockstep and Dance argues persuasively that these cultural images reinforce the idea of black men as prisoners of American justice and of their own minds but also shows how black men struggle against this imprisonment. Linda G. Tucker is an assistant professor of English at Southern Arkansas University. Her work has appeared in Henry Street, American Behavioral Scientist, and Transformations .","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1604731516"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781604731514"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":204,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Psychology"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.3.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CEEnl5dgpkoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CEEnl5dgpkoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CEEnl5dgpkoC&pg=PA78&dq=Lockstep&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CEEnl5dgpkoC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CEEnl5dgpkoC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":25,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.75,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CEEnl5dgpkoC&rdid=book-CEEnl5dgpkoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":25000000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14750000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CEEnl5dgpkoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["sciFi","youngAdult","fiction"],"title":"Lockstep","hashCode":1974903447,"goodReadsId":"21512537"},{"author":"Atwood, Margaret","date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"1GeHO2uy1XQC","etag":"ZRe+NbsYuLg","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1GeHO2uy1XQC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Oryx and Crake","authors":["Margaret Atwood"],"publisher":"Vintage Canada","publishedDate":"2010-07-27","description":"A stunning and provocative new novel by the internationally celebrated author of The Blind Assassin, winner of the Booker Prize. Margaret Atwood’s new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again. The narrator of Atwood's riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake's high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307400840"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307400840"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":416,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":283,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.4.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Oryx+and+Crake&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&dq=Oryx+and+Crake&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Oryx_and_Crake.html?hl=&id=1GeHO2uy1XQC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Oryx_and_Crake-sample-epub.acsm?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers.

Since 2003, Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead has been redefining the survival horror genre with its unique and vivid account of life after the end of the world. Although the cast is diverse and often changing (including, of course, a great number of zombies), at the heart of every tale is Rick Grimes: former police officer, husband, father, and de facto leader of a ragtag band of survivors looking to make a future for themselves in a world that no longer has one. To call The Walking Dead a zombie tale is accurate to a point, but it touches on only one facet of a story that asks timeless questions about what it means to live. It also asks whether or not this is possible in a world full of the dead.

Zack Lightman has never much cared for reality. He vastly prefers the countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he's spent his life consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic, impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand spacefaring adventure. So when he sees the flying saucer, he's sure his years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness. Especially because the alien ship he's staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a flight simulator callled Armada--in which gamers just happen to be protecting Earth from alien invaders. As impossible as it seems, what Zack's seeing is all too real. And it's just the first in a blur of revlations that will force him to question everything he thought he knew about Earth's history, its future, even his own life--and to play the hero for real, with humanity's life in the balance. But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can't help thinking: Doesn't something about this scenario feel a little bit like...well...fiction? At once reinventing and paying homage to science-fiction classics as only Ernest Cline can, Armada is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a coming-of-age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you've ever read before.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780804137263"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0804137269"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":384,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":3,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"2.15.13.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3k-wBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3k-wBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3k-wBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Armada&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3k-wBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3k-wBgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3k-wBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3k-wBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Armada-sample-epub.acsm?id=3k-wBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3k-wBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"At once reinventing and paying homage to science-fiction classics as only Ernest Cline can, Armada is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a coming-of-age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you&#39;ve ever read before."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["sciFi","youngAdult","fiction"],"title":"Armada","hashCode":1969519842,"goodReadsId":"25472802"},{"author":"Hiltzik, Michael","date":"2017-08-02T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"lzgOduibRJgC","etag":"2YuUPhkNcKg","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lzgOduibRJgC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Dealers of Lightning","subtitle":"Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age","authors":["Michael A.

In the 1970s and '80s, Xerox Corporation brought together a brain-trust of engineering geniuses, a group of computer eccentrics dubbed PARC. This brilliant group created several monumental innovations that triggered a technological revolution, including the first personal computer, the laser printer, and the graphical interface (one of the main precursors of the Internet), only to see these breakthroughs rejected by the corporation. Yet, instead of giving up, these determined inventors turned their ideas into empires that radically altered contemporary life and changed the world. Based on extensive interviews with the scientists, engineers, administrators, and executives who lived the story, this riveting chronicle details PARC's humble beginnings through its triumph as a hothouse for ideas, and shows why Xerox was never able to grasp, and ultimately exploit, the cutting-edge innovations PARC delivered. Dealers of Lightning offers an unprecedented look at the ideas, the inventions, and the individuals that propelled Xerox PARC to the frontier of technohistoiy--and the corporate machinations that almost prevented it from achieving greatness.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780061913501"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0061913502"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":480,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":9,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.2.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lzgOduibRJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lzgOduibRJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lzgOduibRJgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dealers+of+Lightning&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lzgOduibRJgC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lzgOduibRJgC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":12.49,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":12.49,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lzgOduibRJgC&rdid=book-lzgOduibRJgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":12490000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":12490000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Dealers_of_Lightning-sample-epub.acsm?id=lzgOduibRJgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lzgOduibRJgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Based on extensive interviews with the scientists, engineers, administrators, and executives who lived the story, this riveting chronicle details PARC&#39;s humble beginnings through its triumph as a hothouse for ideas, and shows why Xerox was ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["business","computerProgramming","nonFiction"],"title":"Dealers of Lightning","hashCode":1243256999,"goodReadsId":"10178289"},{"author":"Van Vogt, A.E.","date":"2017-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ox4NPQAACAAJ","etag":"+bMRw9kK0xc","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ox4NPQAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Empire of Isher","subtitle":"The Weapon Makers / The Weapon Shops of Isher","authors":["A.

Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.

Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes \"Lock In\": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge. A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as \"Haden's syndrome,\" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated. But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost.

Fast Company raves that Creativity, Inc. “just might be the most thoughtful management book ever.” Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, WALL-E, and Inside Out, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable. As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as: • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better. • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them. • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody. Praise for Creativity, Inc. “Over more than thirty years, Ed Catmull has developed methods to root out and destroy the barriers to creativity, to marry creativity to the pursuit of excellence, and, most impressive, to sustain a culture of disciplined creativity during setbacks and success.”—Jim Collins, co-author of Built to Last and author of Good to Great “Too often, we seek to keep the status quo working. This is a book about breaking it.”—Seth Godin From the Hardcover edition.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780679644507"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0679644504"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":368,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":33,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.7.7.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Creativity,+Inc:+Overcoming+the+Unseen+Forces+That+Stand+in+the+Way+of+True+Inspiration&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UqccAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Creativity_Inc-sample-epub.acsm?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UqccAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.

It tells the story of Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus, as seen from the perspective of Professor Pierre Aronnax. Back in the late 1800's, ships of several nations spot a mysterious sea monster, which some suggest to be a giant narwhal. The United States government assembles an expedition in New York City to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French marine biologist and narrator of the story, who happens to be in New York at the time, receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition which he accepts. Canadian master harpoonist Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful servant Conseil are also brought aboard. Title page (1871) The expedition departs Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln and travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean. The ship finds the monster after a long search and then attacks the beast, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are then hurled into the water and grasp hold of the \"hide\" of the creature, which they find, to their surprise, to be a submarine very far ahead of its era. They are quickly captured and brought inside the vessel, where they meet its enigmatic creator and commander, Captain Nemo. The rest of the story follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the creature—the submarine, the Nautilus—which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas free from any land-based government. Captain Nemo's motivation is implied to be both a scientific thirst for knowledge and a desire for revenge on (and self-imposed exile from) civilization.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783736804326"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3736804326"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":413,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":7,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.110.105.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Twenty+Thousand+Leagues+Under+the+Seas&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":2.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":2.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-L8CzAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":2990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea-sample-epub.acsm?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea-sample-pdf.acsm?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=L8CzAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is a classic science fiction novel by French writer Jules Verne.

Now a Prime Original series. Thirteen hundred gates have opened to solar systems around the galaxy. But as humanity builds its interstellar empire in the alien ruins, the mysteries and threats grow deeper. In the dead systems where gates lead to stranger things than alien planets, Elvi Okoye begins a desperate search to discover the nature of a genocide that happened before the first human beings existed, and to find weapons to fight a war against forces at the edge of the imaginable. But the price of that knowledge may be higher than she can pay. At the heart of the empire, Teresa Duarte prepares to take on the burden of her father's godlike ambition. The sociopathic scientist Paolo Cortázar and the Mephistophelian prisoner James Holden are only two of the dangers in a palace thick with intrigue, but Teresa has a mind of her own and secrets even her father the emperor doesn't guess. And throughout the wide human empire, the scattered crew of the Rocinante fights a brave rear-guard action against Duarte's authoritarian regime.

Lloyd Eaton Confer­ence on Fantasy and Science Fiction, is con­cerned with the significance of that question. \"[Anthropology] is the science that must desig­nate the alien if it is to redefine a place for itself in the universe,” according to the Introduction. The idea of the alien is not new. In the Re­naissance, Montaigne’s purpose in describing an alien encounter was excorporation--man­kind was the \"savage” because the artificial devices of nature controlled him. Shake­speare’s version of the alien encounter was in­corporation; his character of Caliban is brought to the artificial, political world of man and incor­porated into the body politic \"The essays in this volume . . . show, in their general orientation, that the tribe of Shakespeare still, in literary studies at least, outnumbers that of Montaigne.” These essays show the interrelation of the excorporating pos­sibilities to the internal soundings of the alien encounter within the human mind and form.

By following the teams that are inventing some of the world's best-loved toys, it spotlights the company's disciplined approach to harnessing creativity and recounts one of the most remarkable business transformations in recent memory. Brick by Brick reveals how LEGO failed to keep pace with the revolutionary changes in kids' lives and began sliding into irrelevance. When the company's leaders implemented some of the business world's most widely espoused prescriptions for boosting innovation, they ironically pushed the iconic toymaker to the brink of bankruptcy. The company's near-collapse shows that what works in theory can fail spectacularly in the brutally competitive global economy. It took a new LEGO management team – faced with the growing rage for electronic toys, few barriers to entry, and ultra-demanding consumers (ten-year old boys) – to reinvent the innovation rule book and transform LEGO into one of the world's most profitable, fastest-growing companies. Along the way, Brick by Brick reveals how LEGO: - Became truly customer-driven by co-creating with kids as well as its passionate adult fans - Looked beyond products and learned to leverage a full-spectrum approach to innovation - Opened its innovation process by using both the \"wisdom of crowds\" and the expertise of elite cliques - Discovered uncontested, \"blue ocean\" markets, even as it thrived in brutally competitive red oceans - Gave its world-class design teams enough space to create and direction to deliver built a culture where profitable innovation flourishes Sometimes radical yet always applicable, Brick by Brick abounds with real-world lessons for unleashing breakthrough innovation in your organization, just like LEGO. Whether you're a senior executive looking to make your company grow, an entrepreneur building a startup from scratch, or a fan who wants to instill some of that LEGO magic in your career, you'll learn how to build your own innovation advantage, brick by brick.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307951625"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307951626"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":320,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":3,"ratingsCount":4,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.5.5.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OsyEX0nPkygC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OsyEX0nPkygC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OsyEX0nPkygC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Brick+by+Brick&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OsyEX0nPkygC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OsyEX0nPkygC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OsyEX0nPkygC&rdid=book-OsyEX0nPkygC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Brick_by_Brick-sample-epub.acsm?id=OsyEX0nPkygC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OsyEX0nPkygC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"It took a new LEGO management team--faced with the growing rage for electronic toys, few barriers to entry, and ultra-demanding consumers (ten-year old boys)--to reinvent the innovation rule book and transform LEGO into one of the world&#39;s ..."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["business","nonFiction"],"title":"Brick by Brick","hashCode":796084169,"goodReadsId":"17190398"},{"author":"Metz, Sandi","date":"2019-06-13T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"rk9sAQAAQBAJ","etag":"iQX2okGL3BI","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rk9sAQAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Practical Object-oriented Design in Ruby","subtitle":"An Agile Primer","authors":["Sandi Metz"],"publisher":"Pearson Education","publishedDate":"2013","description":"The Complete Guide to Writing More Maintainable, Manageable, Pleasing, and Powerful Ruby Applications Ruby's widely admired ease of use has a downside: Too many Ruby and Rails applications have been created without concern for their long-term maintenance or evolution. The Web is awash in Ruby code that is now virtually impossible to change or extend. This text helps you solve that problem by using powerful real-world object-oriented design techniques, which it thoroughly explains using simple and practical Ruby examples. Sandi Metz has distilled a lifetime of conversations and presentations about object-oriented design into a set of Ruby-focused practices for crafting manageable, extensible, and pleasing code. She shows you how to build new applications that can survive success and repair existing applications that have become impossible to change. Each technique is illustrated with extended examples, all downloadable from the companion Web site,poodr.info. The first title to focus squarely on object-oriented Ruby application design, Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby will guide you to superior outcomes, whatever your previous Ruby experience. Novice Ruby programmers will find specific rules to live by; intermediate Ruby programmers will find valuable principles they can flexibly interpret and apply; and advanced Ruby programmers will find a common language they can use to lead development and guide their colleagues. This guide will help you Understand how object-oriented programming can help you craft Ruby code that is easier to maintain and upgrade Decide what belongs in a single Ruby class Avoid entangling objects that should be kept separate Define flexible interfaces among objects Reduce programming overhead costs with duck typing Successfully apply inheritance Build objects via composition Design

BESTSELLER If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets. The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself. Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780804139304"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"080413930X"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":224,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":2795,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.4.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Zero+to+One&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Zero_to_One-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["business","nonFiction"],"title":"Zero to One","hashCode":862052217,"goodReadsId":"22856316"},{"author":"Rand, Ayn","date":"2019-07-20T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"3aQ6DAAAQBAJ","etag":"/tKjOYmkqEQ","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/3aQ6DAAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Anthem","authors":["Ayn Rand"],"publisher":"Xist Publishing","publishedDate":"2016-04-20","description":"Anthem by Ayn Rand from Coterie Classics All Coterie Classics have been formatted for ereaders and devices and include a bonus link to the free audio book. “I stand here on the summit of the mountain.

Like other books in the \"You Don’t Know JS\" series, Scope and Closures dives into trickier parts of the language that many JavaScript programmers simply avoid. Armed with this knowledge, you can achieve true JavaScript mastery. Learn about scope, a set of rules to help JavaScript engines locate variables in your code Go deeper into nested scope, a series of containers for variables and functions Explore function- and block-based scope, “hoisting”, and the patterns and benefits of scope-based hiding Discover how to use closures for synchronous and asynchronous tasks, including the creation of JavaScript libraries","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781449335564"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"144933556X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":98,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.8.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IS0EAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IS0EAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IS0EAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=You+Don%27t+Know+JS:+Scopes+and+Closures&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IS0EAwAAQBAJ&dq=You+Don%27t+Know+JS:+Scopes+and+Closures&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/You_Don_t_Know_JS_Scope_Closures.html?hl=&id=IS0EAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IS0EAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don’t fully understand the language."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["computerProgramming","nonFiction"],"title":"You Don't Know JS: Scopes and Closures","hashCode":1391689455,"goodReadsId":"21445305"},{"author":"Adams, Douglass","date":"2019-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"uU3sPAAACAAJ","etag":"2Ka/2IHYuVw","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/uU3sPAAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Illustrated Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","authors":["Douglas Adams"],"publisher":"Harmony","publishedDate":"1994","description":"The off-beat and occasionally extraterrestrial journeys, notions, and acquaintances of galactic traveler Arthur Dent are illustrated with digitally generated graphic images and tricky visual puns","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0517599244"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780517599242"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":96,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uU3sPAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hitchhiker%27s+Guide+to+the+Galaxy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uU3sPAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hitchhiker%27s+Guide+to+the+Galaxy&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Illustrated_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_th.html?hl=&id=uU3sPAAACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uU3sPAAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The off-beat and occasionally extraterrestrial journeys, notions, and acquaintances of galactic traveler Arthur Dent are illustrated with digitally generated graphic images and tricky visual puns"}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["classics","humor","sciFi","fiction"],"title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","hashCode":1844119450,"goodReadsId":"8710"},{"author":"Adams, Douglass","date":"2019-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"DQ-wif7eBJoC","etag":"LH/3iiN182o","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DQ-wif7eBJoC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe","authors":["Douglas Adams"],"publisher":"Del Rey","publishedDate":"2008-12-24","description":"“Douglas Adams is a terrific satirist.”—The Washington Post Book World Facing annihilation at the hands of the warlike Vogons?

I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. My name is Kvothe. You may have heard of me' So begins the tale of Kvothe - currently known as Kote, the unassuming innkeepter - from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, through his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe the notorious magician, the accomplished thief, the masterful musician, the dragon-slayer, the legend-hunter, the lover, the thief and the infamous assassin.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780575087057"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0575087056"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":672,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":3400,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.19.16.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&dq=The+Name+of+the+Wind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&dq=The+Name+of+the+Wind&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Name_of_the_Wind.html?hl=&id=BcG2dVRXKukC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BcG2dVRXKukC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"&#39;This is a magnificent book&#39; Anne McCaffrey &#39;I was reminded of Ursula K.

Yet, in the uprising against the emperor, the two quickly become the best of friends after a series of adventures fighting against vast conscripted armies, silk-draped airships, and shapeshifting gods. Once the emperor has been overthrown, however, they each find themselves the leader of separate factions—two sides with very different ideas about how the world should be run and the meaning of justice.

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” —Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” —Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” —Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career.

The veteran of four spaceflights and the American record holder for consecutive days spent in space, Scott Kelly has experienced things very few have. Now, he takes us inside a sphere utterly hostile to human life. He describes navigating the extreme challenge of long-term spaceflight, both life-threatening and mundane: the devastating effects on the body; the isolation from everyone he loves and the comforts of Earth; the catastrophic risks of colliding with space junk; and the still more haunting threat of being unable to help should tragedy strike at home--an agonizing situation Kelly faced when, on a previous mission, his twin brother's wife, American Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was shot while he still had two months in space. Kelly's humanity, compassion, humor, and determination resonate throughout, as he recalls his rough-and-tumble New Jersey childhood and the youthful inspiration that sparked his astounding career, and as he makes clear his belief that Mars will be the next, ultimately challenging, step in spaceflight. In Endurance, we see the triumph of the human imagination, the strength of the human will, and the infinite wonder of the galaxy.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781524731601"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1524731609"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":400,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":25,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.7.5.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cpv9CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cpv9CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cpv9CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Endurance:+My+Year+in+Space,+A+Lifetime+of+Discovery&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cpv9CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cpv9CwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cpv9CwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-cpv9CwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Endurance-sample-epub.acsm?id=cpv9CwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cpv9CwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In Endurance, we see the triumph of the human imagination, the strength of the human will, and the infinite wonder of the galaxy."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["nonFiction"],"title":"Endurance: My Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery","hashCode":265423836,"goodReadsId":"29852119"},{"author":"Thiel, Peter","date":"2020-06-13T07:00:00.000Z","googleData":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ZH4oAwAAQBAJ","etag":"IE+wcvpEke8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZH4oAwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Zero to One","subtitle":"Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future","authors":["Peter Thiel","Blake Masters"],"publisher":"Currency","publishedDate":"2014-09-16","description":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets. The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself. Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780804139304"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"080413930X"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":224,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":2795,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.4.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Zero+to+One&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Zero_to_One-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZH4oAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things."}},"notes":null,"review":null,"tags":["business","nonFiction"],"title":"Zero to One","hashCode":862052217,"goodReadsId":"22856316"}];
