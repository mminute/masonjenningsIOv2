            <p>
              No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things:
              it's going to be different, and it must be rooted in today's world
            </p>

            <div>
              Progress takes two forms: horizontal or vertical
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Horizontal (extensive) progress- copying things that work -
                  going from 1 to n
                </li>

                <li>
                  Vertical (intensive) progress- doing new things - going from 0
                  to 1
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Horizontal progress -- Globalization <br />
                In a world of scarse resources, globalization without technoloty
                is unsustainable.

              Startup Thinking:
              <br />
              It's hard to develop new things in big organizations and it's even
              harder to do it by yourself.
              <br />
              Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other
              people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough
              so that you actually can.
              <br />
              A startup is the largest group of people can convince of a plan to
              build a different future.
              <br />
              This book is about the questions you must ask and answer to
              succeed in the business of doing new things.

              The business version of our contrarian question is:{' '}
              <i>what valuable company is nobody building</i>?<br />
              Creating value is not enough- you also need to capture some of the
              value you create.

              Perfect competition vs monopoly:
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  So-called perfectly competitive markets acheive equilibrium
                  when producer supply meets consumer demand.
                  <br />
                  Under perfect competition, in the long run{' '}
                  <i>no company makes an economic profit</i>
                </li>

                <li>
                  A monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. It
                  produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes
                  profits.
                </li>
              </ul>
              If you want to create and capture lasting value, dont't build an

              Lies people tell:
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Monopolists lie to protect themselves. They tend to do
                  whatever they can to conceal their monopoly - usually by
                  exagegerating the power of their (nonexistent) competitors.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Non-monopolists tell the opposite lie: "we're in a league of
                  our own" - understate the scale of competition - describe your
                  market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by
                  definition.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their
                  market as the <i>intersection</i> of various smaller markets.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Monopolists disquise their monopoly by framing their market as
                  the <i>union</i> of several large markets.
                </li>
              </ul>

              Ruthless People
              <br />
              A monopoly like Google is different. Since it doesn't have to
              worry about competing with anyone, it has wider latitiude to care
              about its workers, its products, and its impact on the wider world
              <br />
              <i>[Hmmm..., dunno about that one]</i>
              <br />
              In perfect competition, a business is so focues on today's margins
              that it can't possibly plna for a long term future.

              Monopoly Capitalism
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Monopolies deserve their bad reputation-{' '}
                  <i>but only in a world where nothing changes</i>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding
                  entirely new categories of abundance to the world
                </li>

                <li>
                  But the history of progress is a history of better monopoly
                  businesses replacing incumbents
                </li>

                <li>
                  So why are economists obsessed with competition as an ideal
                  state? It's a relic of history. Economists copied their
                  mathematics fromt the work of 19th century physicists: they
                  see individuals and businesses as interchangeable atoms, not
                  as unique creators.
                </li>

                <li>
                  In business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Every business is successful exactly to the extent that it
                  does something others cannot.
                </li>

                <li>
                  All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape
                  competition.

          <Chapter idx="4" title="The Ideology of Competition">
            <p>
              But really it's competition, not business, that is like war:
              allegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately
              destructive.
            </p>

            <div>
              Why do people compete with each other?
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Marx: because they are different. The proletariat fights the
                  bourgeoisie because they have completely different ideas and
                  goals (generated, for Marx, by their very different material
                  circumstances). The greater the differences, the greater the
                  conflict.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Shakespeare: all combatants look more or less alike. It's not
                  clear why they should be fighting. In the world of business,
                  at least, Shakespeare proves the superior guide.

                <li>
                  Amid all the human drama, people lose sight of what matters
                  and focus on their rivals instead.

                  Each company was obsessed with defeating its rivals, precisely
                  because there were no substantive differences to focus on.
                </li>

                <li>
                  These companies totally lost sight of the wider question of
                  whether the online pet supply market was the right space to be
                  in. Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when
                  the war isn's one worth fighting.

              Characteristics of Monopoly
              <br />
              ... they usually share some combination of the following
              characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects,
              economies of scale, and branding.
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Proprietary Technology
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a
                      company can have because it makes your product difficult
                      or impossible to replicate.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be
                      10x better than its closes substitue in some important
                      dimension to lead to monopolistic advantage. Anything less
                      than an order of magnitute better will probably be
                      perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to
                      sell, especially in an already crowded market.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent
                      something completely new.

                    <li>

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the
                      fixed cost of creating a product (engineering, management,
                      office space) can be spread out over ever greater
                      quantities of scale.

                    <li>
                      Software startups can enjoy especially dramatic economies

                    <li>
                      Originally, "disruption" was a term of art to describe how
                      a firm can use new technology to introduce a low-end
                      product at low prices, improve the product over time, and
                      eventually overtake even the premium product offered by
                      imcumbent comapnies using older technology
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      However, disruption has recently be transmogrified into a
                      self-congratulatory buzzword for anything posing as trendy
                      and new.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      The concept was coined to describe threats to incumbent
                      companies, so startup's obsession with disruption mean
                      they see themselved through older firm's eyes
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      ? So disruption places the company implicitly in a
                      position of competition?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't
                      disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible

                  Even in engineering-driven Silicon Valley, the buzzwords of
                  the moment call for building a "lean startup" that can "adapt"
                  and "evolve" to an ever-changing environment. We're supposed

              The power law-- so named because exponential equations describe
              severely unequal distribution-- is the law of the universe.

              The power law of venture capitalism
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Most venture backed startups fail and most venture funds also
                  fail
                </li>

                <li>
                  The error lies in expecting that venture returns will be
                  normally distributed like:
                  <ul>
                    <li>bad companies fail</li>
                    <li>mediocre ones will stay flat</li>
                    <li>good ones will return 2x or even 4x</li>

                <li>

                  portfolio and hopt that the winners counterbalance losers.

                <li>
                  "spray and pray" does not work because venture returns don'f
                  follow a normal distribution overall. Rather they follow a
                  power law-- a small number of companies radically outperform
                  all others.

                    <li>
                      because rule #1 is so restrictive, there can't be any

                  Whenever you shift from the substance of a business to the financial question of whether or not it fits into a diversified hedging strategy, venture investing starts to look a lot like buing lottery tickets.

                  An entrepreneur makes a major investment just by spending her time working on a startup.
                  Therefor every entrepeneur must think about whether her company is going to suceed and become valuable.
                </li>

                <li>
                  People who understand the power law will hesistate more than others when it comes to founding a new venture:
                  they know how tremendously successful they could become by joining the very best company while it's growing fast.
                  The poer law means that the difference <i>between</i> companies dwarf the differences <i>inside</i> companies.

                <li>
                  To say that there are no secrets left today would mean that we live in a society with no hidden injustices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers.

              How to find secrets

                <li>
                  Two kinds of secrets:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      secrets of nature

                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Secrets about people are different: they are things that people don't know about themselves or things they hide because they don't want others to know.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking.  Are there any fields that matter but haven't been standardized or institutionalized?

              What to do with secrets
              <ul>
                <li>
                  So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there's always a golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody- and that's a company.
                </li>

                <li>
                  A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.

                Bad decisions made early on- if you choose the wrong partner or hire the wrong people, for example-

                  Choosing a co-founder is like getting maried.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together- otherwise they're just rollin the dice

              <ul>
                <li>
                  You need good people who get along, but you also need a structure to help keep everyone aligned for the long term
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ownership: Who legally owns a company's equity?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Possesion: Who actially runs the company on a day-to-day basis?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Control: Who formally governs the comapny's affairs?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Distributing these function among different people makes sense, but it also multiplies opportunities for misalignment
                </li>
                <li>
                  Big corporation do better than the DMV, but they're still prone to misalignment, <i>especially between ownership and possesion</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Early-stage startups are small enough that founders usually have both ownership and possesion.  Most conflicts in a startup erupt between ownership and control- that is, between founders and investors on the board.

                  A board of three is ideal.  Your board should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly traded,

                </li>
                <li>
                  In no case should a CEO of an early-stage venture backed startup receive more than $150k per year in salary
                </li>
                <li>
                  Low CEO pay also sets the standard for everyone else
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a CEO doesn't set an example by taking the lowest salary in the company, he can do the same thing by drawing the highest salary. 
                  So long as that figure is still modest, it sets an effective ceiling on cash compensation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  High cash compensation teaches workers to claim value from the company as it already exists instead of investing their time to create new value in the future

                  The best startups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults.

                <li>
                  First it sounds likely to create an insular and myopic point of view, but as a small startup 
                  this books argues that you should be hyper focused on a small market, so maybe that isn't as much of a hinderance
                </li>
                <li>
                  But a small homogeneous initial cohort seems likely to me to continue growing in a homogenoeus way. 
                  When do you stop recruiting for similar "early staff" and start considering people who might be different from you?

              Nerds vs Salesmen
              <ul>
                <li>
                  US sales industry is a $450 billion annually
                </li>
                <li>
                  When they hear that 3.2 million Americans work in sales, seasoned executives will suspect the number is low, but engineers may sigh in bewilderment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adevertising matters because it works
                </li>
                <li>
                  But advertising doesn't exist to make you buy a product right away; it exists to embed subtle impressions that will drive sales later.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nerds are used to transparency... Sales is the opposite; an orchestrated campaign to change surface appearances without changing the underlying reality.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              Sales Is Hidden
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sales works best when hidden, this explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution - 
                  whether they're in sales, marketing or advertising - has a job title that ahs nothing to do with those things.... none of us wants to be reminded when we're being sold.                  
                </li>
                <li>
                  The most fundametal reason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the <i>systemic effort to hide it at every level of every field in a world secretly driven by it.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you've invented something new but you haven't invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business - no matter how good the product

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Two metrics set the limits for effective distrubution
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Total net profit that you earn on average over the course of your relationship with a customer (Customer Lifetime Value- CLV) must exceed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      the amount you spend to acquire a new customer (Customer Acquisition Cost- CAC)
                    </li>

                  Complex Sales - $1,000,000+
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Complex sales works best when you don't have "salesmen"... At that price point buyers want to talk to the CEO, not the VP of Sales
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Business with complex sales models succeed if you achieve 50% to 100% yeer-over-year growht over the course of a decade

                    <li>
                      The challenge here isn't how to make any particular sale, but how to establish a process by which a sales team 
                      of modest size can move the product to a wide audience
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      The product needs a personal sales effort, but at that price point, you simply don't have the resources to send an actual person to talk 
                      to every prospective customer. This is why so many small and medium-sized businesses don't use tools that bigger 
                      firms take for granted... distribution is the hidden bottleneck

                      Marketing and advertising work for relatively <i>low priced</i> products that have <i>mass appeal</i> but lack any method for viral distribution

                      Advertising can work for startups, too, but only when your customer acquisition cost and customer lifetime value make every other distribution channel uneconomical.

                Paradoxically, impersonal bureaucracies staffed by trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but they usually act with short time horizons.

              Our task is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better - to go from 0 to 1.  The essential first step is to <i>think for yourself</i>.
